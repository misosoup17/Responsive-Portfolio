                    Welcome to my basic portfolio page. I started this site to showcase some of my interests, hobbies, past-times or whatever else you may call them. In recent years I have been called a renaissance man. That is, a person with many talents. I love to learn and I also love to teach others what I have learned. Perhaps you can learn something by checking out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Page</a>. If you have an questions be sure to <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I have already mentioned, I love to learn.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many things that I enjoy doing. So many I don't want to talk about all of them right here. Enjoy checking out my portfolio! Also, I look forward to hearing from you!
